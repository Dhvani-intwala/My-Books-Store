Design

The website was designed with a minimalistic style to align with the site's objectives. The simple design allows users to easily navigate through the site and find what they are looking for.

Colour Scheme

The design is quite simple. The colour scheme is used to ensure that there is a good contrast with the text and to create a clean and visually appealing look across the site. The scheme establishes a strong contrast between the background colors and text and, at the same time, ensures that the site meets accessibility requirements.


| Color         |Hex    |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Blue | ![#444646](/media/0f0e0e.png) #444646 |
| Green | ![#c6c0c4](media/018031.png) #018031|
| Red | ![#FF0000](media/ff0000.png) #FF0000 |
| White | ![#ffffff](media/ffffff.png) #ffffff |
| Dark gray | ![#0f0e0e](media/0f0e0e.png) #0f0e0e |
| dark | ![#2c313c](media/2c313c.png) #2c313c|
| Light gray | ![#dadadf](media/dadadf.png) #dadadf |

## Agile Methodology
This project was developed using the agile methodology. All progress in implementing Epics and User Stories was captured using Trello. Necessary goals and priorities were well defined throughout the project. In addition, labels were used to define the priority of each user story on the Kanban board. As user stories were completed, they were moved from the To Do, Progress, and Done lists in the Trello board.

## AWS Setup Process

### AWS S3 Bucket 

The deployed site uses AWS S3 Buckets to store the webpages static and media files. More information on how you can set up an AWS S3 Bucket can be found below:

1. Create an AWS account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Login to your account and within the search bar type in "S3".
3. Within the S3 page click on the button that says "Create Bucket".
4. Name the bucket and select the region which is closest to you.
5. Underneath "Object Ownership" select "ACLs enabled".
6. Uncheck "Block Public Access" and acknowledge that the bucket will be made public, then click "Create Bucket".
7. Inside the created bucket click on the "Properties" tab. Below "Static Website Hosting" click "Edit" and change the Static website hosting option to "Enabled". Copy the default values for the index and error documents and click "Save Changes".
8. Click on the "Permissions" tab, below "Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)", click "Edit" and then paste in the following code:

  ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
  ```

9. Within the "Bucket Policy" section. Click "Edit" and then "Policy Generator". Click the "Select Type of Policy" dropdown and select "S3 Bucket Policy" and within "Principle" allow all principals by typing "*".
10. Within the "Actions" dropdown menu select "Get Object" and in the previous tab copy the "Bucket ARN number". Paste this within the policy generator within the field labelled "Amazon Resource Name (ARN)".
11. Click "Add statement > Generate Policy" and copy the policy that's been generated and paste this into the "Bucket Policy Editor".
12. Before saving, add /* at the end of your "Resource Key", this will allow access to all resources within the bucket.
13. Once saved, scroll down to the "Access Control List (ACL)" and click "Edit".
14. Next to "Everyone (public access)", check the "list" checkbox and save your changes.

### IAM Set Up

1. Search for IAM within the AWS navigation bar and select it.
2. Click "User Groups" that can be seen in the side bar and then click "Create group" and name the group 'manage-your-project-name'.
3. Click "Policies" and then "Create policy".
4. Navigate to the JSON tab and click "Import Managed Policy", within here search "S3" and select "AmazonS3FullAccess" followed by "Import".
5. Navigate back to the recently created S3 bucket and copy your "ARN Number". Go back to "This Policy" and update the "Resource Key" to include your ARN Number, and another line with your ARN followed by a "/*".
   
- Below is an example of what this should look like:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "s3-object-lambda:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE",
                "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

1. Ensure the policy has been given a name and a short description, then click "Create Policy".
2. Click "User groups", and then the group you created earlier. Under permissions click "Add Permission" and from the dropdown click "Attach Policies".
3. Select "Users" from the sidebar and click "Add User".
4. Provide a username and check "Programmatic Access", then click 'Next: Permissions'.
5. Ensure your policy is selected and navigate through until you click "Add User".
6. Download the "CSV file", which contains the user's access key and secret access key.

### Connecting AWS to the Project

1. Within your terminal install the following packages by typing 

```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages 
```  

2. Freeze the requirements by typing:

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. Add "storages" to your installed apps within your settings.py file.
4. At the bottom of the settings.py file add the following code:

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```
5. Add the following keys within Heroku: "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY". These can be found in your CSV file.
6. Add the key "USE_AWS", and set the value to True within Heroku.
6. Remove the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTAIC" variable from Heroku.
7. Within your settings.py file inside the code just written add: 

```
  AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f"{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com"
```
8. Inside the settings.py file inside the bucket config if statement add the following lines of code:
```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

9. In the root directory of your project create a file called "custom_storages.py". Import the following at the top of this file and add the classes below:

```
  from django.conf import settings
  from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

  class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

  class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

10. Navigate back to you AWS S3 Bucket and click on "Create Folder" name this folder "media", within the media file click "Upload > Add Files" and select the images for your site.
11. Under "Permissions" select the option "Grant public-read access" and click "Upload".

## Stripe Payments

- The Stripe payments system is set up as the online payment processing and credit card processing platform for the purchases. 
You will need a stripe account which you can sign up for [here](https://stripe.com/en-ie)

### Payments 

- To set up stripe payments you can follow their guid [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details)

### Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on "Webhooks", then "Add endpoint".
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:
   
    ```
    https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
    ```

4. Then click "+ Select events" and check the "Select all events" checkbox at the top before clicking "Add events" at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking "Add endpoint".
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your heroku config vars.
6. Head over to your app in heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:
   
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'

    ```
8. Finally, back in your settings.py file in django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```
