## Agile Methodology

This project was developed using the agile methodology. All progress in implementing Epics and User Stories was captured using Trello. Necessary goals and priorities were well defined throughout the project. In addition, labels were used to define the priority of each user story on the Kanban board. As user stories were completed, they were moved from the To Do, Progress, and Done lists in the Trello board.

## Testing
