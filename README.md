### Strategy

    My books store is a e-commerce business. Due to pressure of life from work and family,
    people have opted for online shopping.

### Colour Scheme

    The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on a yellow, black and white.
    This colour scheme gives off a earthly, warm and happy feeling to the website.
